upstream readme:

This benchmark is based on [Gdev benchmark suite][1], which was developed by
Shinpei Kato from Rodinia 2.0.1.
The original Rodinia benchmark is modified to use the CUDA Driver API instead
of the CUDA Runtime API.

The original Rodinia project can be found at:

https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/index.php

Please download the dataset from the original package:

http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/Rodinia/download_links.htm

The Rodinia benchmark written with CUDA runtime API can be found at:

https://github.com/yuhc/gpu-rodinia

We add a simple testing program for both CUDA driver and OpenCL API benchmarks.
`tester.sh` executes all benchmarks listed in `benchmarks`, and `parser.sh`
is used to parse the measured results.

Same as Gdev benchmark, we redistribute this modified Rodinia benchmark under
the original [Rodinia license][2].
